    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and maintain. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
